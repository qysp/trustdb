# TrustDB

Please note that this is still a work-in-progress and there might be major changes to the API in the future.

## Quick overview

TrustDB is a promise-based, lightweight in-memory and persistent JavaScript/JSON database which got inspired by [LokiJS](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS).
Its main goal is not to be extremely feature-rich but rather to provide a lightweight and robust database API without heavy dependencies.

## Using TrustDB
